# OCR with Tesseract and PDF Processing

This Python script demonstrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract and processing PDF files to extract text from images.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Tesseract OCR installed and configured
- Poppler for PDF processing

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

   Install the required Python packages:
bash

pip install pdf2image pytesseract opencv-python

Set the Tesseract executable path in the script (ocr_pdf_processing.py):
python

    pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'  # Update this path if necessary

Usage

    Place your PDF file that you want to extract text from in the repository root.

    Run the script ocr_pdf_processing.py using Python:
    bash

    python ocr_pdf_processing.py

    The script will convert the PDF to images, perform OCR using Tesseract, and display the extracted text in the console.

Additional Information

    You can customize the Tesseract OCR options by modifying the custom_config variable in the script.
    The script uses Python libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, and pdf2image for image processing, OCR, and PDF conversion.
    Make sure to have the necessary dependencies and paths set up correctly before running the script.
